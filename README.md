# Graph-Coloring-Using-Quantum-Computing
Solving the general planar graph coloring problem using Grover's Algorithm

Given 4 nodes to be coloured using 4 colours, we represent each color using 2 binary bits and build the quantum circuit to apply the Grover search algorithm for proper colouring.

We visualize the results in the histogram and look for the most likely outcomes which will give us the proper colouring of graph:

Finally, we convert the binary strings to the corresponding coloring.
